<h1>The design problem</h1>
The current market for desk lamps is divided between overly simplistic models that lack flexibility and complex ones that overwhelm users with unnecessary features. This gap leaves users struggling to find a solution that balances simplicity and adaptability with an affordable price.

<h1>The solution</h1>
We created a desk lamp that combine automation with user control to deliver a smarter, energy-efficient, and user-friendly lighting solution. Our product automatically turns on and off by detecting human presence and adjusts its brightness according to the surrounding light levels. However, users still have full control to disable these functions, allowing for manual operation when preferred.
